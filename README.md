# Predictive_Maintenance
This is a simple predictive maintenance project using multiple linear regression. 
The dataset used is not a standard dataset rather it is a dummy dataset created by me. 
The model takes input values like no of hours before maintenance and works best for values in range between 300 to 2000.
Average hours of use everyday and works best for values in range 6 to 15 and number of days after last maintenance in range  20 to 100. 
The accuracy of the model is about 75%.
